# Consensys Final Project - Token Bundler Concept
## Overview
This project will create a tool that will let authenticated token holders claim another token (bundled token). The bundled token can only be claimed by a defined number of token holders. The bundled token will incorporate some of the properties of the tokens that are included in the bundle. The user will still have ownership of their original token in addition to the new bundled token.
## Workflow
<ol>
<li>User acquires Token</li>
<li>User authenticates themselves on a website with their Wallet & Token</li>
<li>User claims one of the limited spots for the Bundled Token</li>
<li>Once all spots are claimed by other unique wallets, a new Bundled Token will be minted<li>
<li>The new Bundled Token will be sent to the Wallets that claimed a post during the minting process</li>
</ol>
